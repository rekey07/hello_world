# hello_world
Have you ever sailed across an ocean Donald?
On a sailboat surrounded by sea with no land in sight,without even the possibility of sighting land for days to come.
To stand at the helm of your destiny... I want that one more time.

I wanna be in Piazza del Compo in Siena,
to feel the surge as ten racehorses go thundering by.
I want another meal in Paris at L'Ambroisie in the place des Vasges.
I want another bottle of wine, and then another.

I want the wormth of a woman in a cool set of sheets.
One more night of jazz at the Vanguard.

I wanna stand on summits and smoke Cubans and feel the son on my face for as long as I can.
Walk on the wall again.
Climb the tawer, Ride the river. Stare at the frescos.

I wanna sit in the garden and read one more good book.
Most of all, I wanna sleep.
I wanna sleep like I slept when I was a boy.
Give me that.
Just one time.
